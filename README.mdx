Inorder to persist data across rerenders we use states. 

There would be cases when a common piece of data is to be shared between multiple components. 
In that case what we do is, keep the state with a common parent. This called lifting up of state. Now we need ways to passdown 
the state from this common parent to down the children. This can be done in many ways, and I am discussing a few bellow.

Approach 1

```
function ButtonText(props){
  return(
    <p>The count is: {props.count}</p>
  )
}

function Button(props){
  return(
    <ButtonText count={props.countValue}/>
  )
}

class Parent extends React.Component{
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    this.state={
      count:0
    }
  }
  
  render(){
    return( 
      <Button countValue={this.state.count}/>
    )
  }
}
```

With approach 1 we can see that the `<Button/>` is not at all using the `countValue` props and it is just passing it down
to the `<ButtonText/>`. This can be avoided by keeping the state closest to the children using it.
